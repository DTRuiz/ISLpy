    "The linear model has distinct advantages in terms of intference and, on real-world problems, is often surprisingly competitive in relation to non-linear methods. This chapter discussing some ways in which the simple linear model can be improved, by replacing plain least squares fitting with some alternative fitting procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, you ask, might we want to use another fitting procedure instead of least squares? We will see that alternative fitting procedures can yield better *_prediction accuracy_* and *_model interpretability_*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Prediction Accuracy_**: Provided that the true relationship between the response and the predictors is approximately linear, the least squares estimates will have low bias. If *_n >> p_*, that is, the number of observations is much larger than variables, then the least squares estimates tend to also have low variance, and hence will perform well on test observations. *_However_*, if *_n_* is not much larger than *_p_*, then there can be a lot of variability in the least squares fit, resulting in overfitting and consequently poor predictions on future observations not used in model training. And if *_p > n_*, then there is no longer a unique least squares coefficient estimate: the variance is *_infinite_* so the method cannot be used at all. By **_constraining_** or **_shrinking_** the estimated coefficients, we can often substantially reduce the variance at the cost of a negligible increase in bias. This can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy with which we can predict the response for observations not used in model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Model Interpretability_**: It is often the case that some or many of the variables used in a multiple regression model are in fact not associated with the response. Including such *_irrelevant_* variables leads to unnecessary complexity in the resulting model. By removing these variables—that is, by setting the corresponding coefficient estimates to zero—we can obtain a model that is more easily interpreted. Now least squares is extremely unlikely to yield any coefficient estimates that are exactly zero. In this chapter, we see some approaches for automatically performing **_feature selection_** or **_variable selection_**—that is, for excluding irrelevant variables from a multiple regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter outlines three important classes of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Subset Selection_**: This approach involves identifying a subset of the *_p_* predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We then fit a model using least squares on the reduced set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Shrinkage_**: This approach involves fitting a model involving all *_p_* predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. This shrinkage (also known as **_regularization_**) has the effect of reducing variance. Depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be estimated to be exactly zero. Hence, shrinkage methods can also perform variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Dimension Reduction_**: This approach involves projecting the *_p_* predictors into a *_M_*-dimensional subspace, where *_M < p_*. This is achieved by computing *_M_* different **_linear combinations_**, or **_projections_**, of the variables. Then these *_M_* projections are used as predictors to fit a linear regression model by least squares."

Consequently, best subset selection becomes computationally infeasible for values of *_p_* greater than around 40, even with extremely fast modern computers.\n",

    "**Forward Stepwise Selection** Considers $1+(p-k)$ models. Starts with a null model, containing no predictors.

    "Though both forward and backward stepwise selection ten to do well in practice, neither are not guaranteed to yield the best model containing a subset of the *_p_* predictors.
