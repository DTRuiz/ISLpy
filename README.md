Introduction to Statistical Learning _with Python_

This repo works through the conceptual and applied exercises found in the excellent book _[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)_ by James, Whitten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. However, instead of R we will be using Python and the requisite libraries.

>_"This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist."_

There is also a very good [MOOC](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/) that accompanies this book that is taught by co-authors and Stanford University professors Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. Prof's Hastie and Tibshirani also co-authored the canonical _[Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)_ which is a more advanced treatment of the topics discussed in ISL.
