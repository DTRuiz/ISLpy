Introduction to Statistical Learning _with Python_

This repo works through the conceptual and applied exercises found in the excellent book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Whitten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. However, instead of R we will be using Python and the requisite libraries.

>_"This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist."_

## Python libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
