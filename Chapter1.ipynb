    "\n",
    "**Supervised** statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predictiong, or estimating, an _output_ based on one or more _inputs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised** statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervsing inputs; nevertheless we can learn relationships and stucture from such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Wage Data:_**\n",
    "* We wish to understand the association between an employee's `age`, `education`, and calendar `year` on his `wage`.\n",
    "* Involves predicting a _continuous_ or _quantitative_ output value. This is often referred to as a **_regression_** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain cases, we may with to predict a non-numerical value -- that is, a _categorical_ or _qualitative_ output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Smarket Data:_**\n",
    "* The goal is to precict whether the S&P index will _increase_ or _decrease_ on a given day using the past 5 days' percentage changes in the index.\n",
    "* We predict whether a given day's performance will fall into the `Up` bucket or the `Down` bucket. This is known as a **_classification_** problem.\n",
